# Bench-Marking-of-Hardware-CPU-
The goal, generally, of writing benchmarks is to measure the performance of a piece of code. Benchmarks are useful for comparing multiple solutions to the same problem to select the most appropriate one. Other times, benchmarks can highlight the performance impact of design or algorithm changes and quantify them in a meaningful way.
By measuring code performance, eliminate errors in assumptions about what the "right" solution is for performance. Only through measurement can confirm that using a lookup table, for example, is faster than computing a value. Such lore (which is often repeated) can lead to bad design decisions and, ultimately, slower code.
The goal in writing good benchmarking code is to eliminate all of the noise and overhead, and measure just the code under test.
