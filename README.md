# Bench-Marking-of-Hardware-CPU-
The goal, generally, of writing benchmarks is to measure the performance of a piece of code. Benchmarks are useful for comparing multiple solutions to the same problem to select the most appropriate one. Other times, benchmarks can highlight the performance impact of design or algorithm changes and quantify them in a meaningful way.
